      The &GAP; package Ferret provides a variety of search methods over permutation groups, including (but not limited to) group intersection and finding the stabilizer, minimal image and canonical image of various objects in a group..

    Hello!
    <Chapter Label="Search">
      <Heading>Search</Heading>

      This chapter is based entirely around of <C>Search</C> method, which provides a way of searching permutation groups, and finding the group (or coset, or single permutation) which occurs in the intersection of a series of groups. <C>Search</C> is a generic method which can be used to replace a number of GAP methods, including <C>Intersection</C>, <C>Stabilizer</C>, and a variety of other methods. See the Examples section at the end of this chapter.
